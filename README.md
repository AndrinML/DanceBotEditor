# Dancebot Editor

This is the Android version for the dancebot editor.
It was developed in collaboration with the ASL (Autonomous Systems Lab) at ETH Zurich
The app let's students create choreography of mp3 files for Dancebots they create in a workshop.

## Demo

The mobile version of the Dancebot Editor will facilitate the creation of a choreography for dancebots.
Since the app is not yet available on the Play Store a few screenshots will demonstrate the look and feel.
